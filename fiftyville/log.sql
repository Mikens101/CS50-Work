-- (161 :: Ruth)    Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief
--                  get into a car in the bakery parking lot and drive away.

--                  Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery, I was walking
--                  by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.
-- (163 :: Raymond) As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them
--                  for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say that they were
--                  planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then
--                  asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
